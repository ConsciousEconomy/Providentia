# Providentia
Replaces the Wordpress REST api with OrbitDB. The goal of the project is to be a black-end for the project Calypso. Thus, with Calypso as the front-end and Providentia on the back-end the goal is to have a Wordpress environment running on IFPS. This will go a long way to help the web become decentralized.
